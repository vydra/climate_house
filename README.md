# Climate House
A house that can survive hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and flood.

I would love to have a small house located in a beautiful place. I like pine forests, I like begin close to the water.
With our climate getting more violent, the prospect of owning a house built with traditional methods is a daunting one 
with insurance either not available or too expensive.
